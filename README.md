# UX-Design
In Honours, as a group of 4 we were required to represents a consulting company as UX Designers which works with JSE-listed companies. The company tasked us with designing a project overview dashboard to track the various client projects it takes on at any one time.
The dashboard should be accessible via mobile and desktop and allow the user to see all projects at a glance. It should allow the user to easily track profitability indicators in order to identify projects that are flagged for review.
The company also wants to be able to drill into a project detailed view to see additional project information before they take action on an account. We were required to present our design in front of lecturers(They represent clients) and class to show the functionality of our design using Figma.

### Key Stakeholders:
1. Management Team: To see all projects.
2. Project Leads: They are primarily interested in their projects, but they can
access all project information if required.
